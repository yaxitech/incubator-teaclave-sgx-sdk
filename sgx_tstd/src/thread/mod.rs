/// Spawns a new thread, returning a [`JoinHandle`] for it.
///
/// The join handle provides a [`join`] method that can be used to join the spawned
/// thread. If the spawned thread panics, [`join`] will return an [`Err`] containing
/// the argument given to [`panic!`].
///
/// If the join handle is dropped, the spawned thread will implicitly be *detached*.
/// In this case, the spawned thread may no longer be joined.
/// (It is the responsibility of the program to either eventually join threads it
/// creates or detach them; otherwise, a resource leak will result.)
///
/// This call will create a thread using default parameters of [`Builder`], if you
/// want to specify the stack size or the name of the thread, use this API
/// instead.
///
/// As you can see in the signature of `spawn` there are two constraints on
/// both the closure given to `spawn` and its return value, let's explain them:
///
/// - The `'static` constraint means that the closure and its return value
///   must have a lifetime of the whole program execution. The reason for this
///   is that threads can outlive the lifetime they have been created in.
///
///   Indeed if the thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive their
///   caller, we need to make sure that they will be valid afterwards, and since
///   we *can't* know when it will return we need to have them valid as long as
///   possible, that is until the end of the program, hence the `'static`
///   lifetime.
/// - The [`Send`] constraint is because the closure will need to be passed
///   *by value* from the thread where it is spawned to the new thread. Its
///   return value will need to be passed from the new thread to the thread
///   where it is `join`ed.
///   As a reminder, the [`Send`] marker trait expresses that it is safe to be
///   passed from thread to thread. [`Sync`] expresses that it is safe to have a
///   reference be passed from thread to thread.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the OS fails to create a thread; use [`Builder::spawn`]
/// to recover from such errors.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Creating a thread.
///
/// ```
/// use std::thread;
///
/// let handler = thread::spawn(|| {
///     // thread code
/// });
///
/// handler.join().unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// As mentioned in the module documentation, threads are usually made to
/// communicate using [`channels`], here is how it usually looks.
///
/// This example also shows how to use `move`, in order to give ownership
/// of values to a thread.
///
/// ```
/// use std::thread;
/// use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
///
/// let (tx, rx) = channel();
///
/// let sender = thread::spawn(move || {
///     tx.send("Hello, thread".to_owned())
///         .expect("Unable to send on channel");

/// # park and unpark
///
/// Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the
/// [`thread::park`][`park`] function and [`thread::Thread::unpark`][`unpark`]
/// method. [`park`] blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from
/// another thread by calling the [`unpark`] method on the blocked thread's
/// handle.
///
/// Conceptually, each [`Thread`] handle has an associated token, which is
/// initially not present:
///
/// * The [`thread::park`][`park`] function blocks the current thread unless or
///   until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it
///   atomically consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without
///   consuming the token. [`thread::park_timeout`] does the same, but allows
///   specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.
///
/// * The [`unpark`] method on a [`Thread`] atomically makes the token available
///   if it wasn't already. Because the token is initially absent, [`unpark`]
///   followed by [`park`] will result in the second call returning immediately.
///
/// In other words, each [`Thread`] acts a bit like a spinlock that can be
/// locked and unlocked using `park` and `unpark`.
///
/// Notice that being unblocked does not imply any synchronization with someone
/// that unparked this thread, it could also be spurious.
/// For example, it would be a valid, but inefficient, implementation to make both [`park`] and
/// [`unpark`] return immediately without doing anything.
///
/// The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
/// placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
/// find it, and then `park`ing in a loop. When some desired condition is met, another
/// thread calls [`unpark`] on the handle.
///
/// The motivation for this design is twofold:
///
/// * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
///   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic
///   blocking/signaling.
///
/// * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.

///         // We *could* get here spuriously, i.e., way before the 10ms below are over!

/// Parallelism is a resource. A given machine provides a certain capacity for

/// computer has, but it may diverge in various cases.

/// restrict the amount of parallelism made available to programs in them. This
/// is often done to limit the potential impact of (unintentionally)
/// resource-intensive programs on other programs running on the same machine.
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// The purpose of this API is to provide an easy and portable way to query
/// the default amount of parallelism the program should use. Among other things it
/// does not expose information on NUMA regions, does not account for
/// differences in (co)processor capabilities, and will not modify the program's
/// global state in order to more accurately query the amount of available
/// parallelism.
///
/// Resource limits can be changed during the runtime of a program, therefore the value is
/// not cached and instead recomputed every time this function is called. It should not be
/// called from hot code.
///
/// The value returned by this function should be considered a simplified
/// approximation of the actual amount of parallelism available at any given
/// time. To get a more detailed or precise overview of the amount of
/// parallelism available to the program, you may wish to use
/// platform-specific APIs as well. The following platform limitations currently
/// apply to `available_parallelism`:
///
/// On Linux:
/// - It may overcount the amount of parallelism available when limited by a
///   process-wide affinity mask, or when affected by cgroup limits.
///
/// On all targets:
/// - It may overcount the amount of parallelism available when running in a VM
/// with CPU usage limits (e.g. an overcommitted host).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function will, but is not limited to, return errors in the following
/// cases:
///
/// - If the amount of parallelism is not known for the target platform.
/// - If the program lacks permission to query the amount of parallelism made
///   available to it.
